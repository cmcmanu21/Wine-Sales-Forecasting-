This was an assignment from Dr. Xue Guo's Advanced Business Analytics course at UNC Charlotte's School of Data Science. The goal of this assignment was to forecast Australian red wine sales with data from 1980 through 1994. There were four different forecasting models used...

1.) Linear Trend

2.) Seasonality 

3.) Linear Trend and Seasonality 

4.) Simple Exponential Smoothing

The performance of each model was compared and the best forecasting model was chosen based on the lowest MAPE value.
